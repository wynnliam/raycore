A simple raycasting based game engine

# Overview
raycore is a simple game engine. The backbone of the engine is a technique
called "raycasting". Please read [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting)
for a quick summary. For an even quicker summary, raycasting is a way
to simulate 3D environments. It was most famously used in the game
Wolfenstein 3D by iD Software in the early 90's.

# A brief history of raycore
In brief, raycore is the project for my CS 461p class at Portland State Unviersity.
However, raycore has a history before thic class. In the Spring of 2018, I implemented
a raycasting-based renderer for CS 410p (Full Stack Web Development). Indeed, it
was a fully front-end web app program. It was written in C, which was compiled into
Javascript (using emscripten).

When this class ended, I continued tuning the system. I occasionally added features here
and there. In the Fall of 2018, I began working on the raycaster again for another class.
This time it was CS 446 (Advance Topics in Machine Learning). My goal was to implement a
texture generating system using a Generative Adversarial Neural Network. Ultimately, I
abandoned that model for a Variational Autoencoder. This project is still ongoing. When it
is more complete, I shall post it somewhere on Github.

Between the Winter and Spring of 2019, I started refering to the raycaster as "Spaceman".
The vision was to put my renderer to use and make a simple walking simulator. The premise
was you were to be a spaceman that just... walked around. You see, my renderer couldn't
do anything other than walk around. "Spaceman" was to be a more complete tech demo.

Now, for CS 461p, my last class at Portland State, I wanted to build something more complete.
So my goal is to build a complete engine, which I have hence dubbed "raycore".
